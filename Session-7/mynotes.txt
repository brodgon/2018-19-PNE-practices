Here I will take my notes!!

Creates a program which generates communication between a client and a server.

The client starts the communication asking something to the server and the server response.Servers can attend several clients.
If there are no clients, the server will wait until some client connect.
If a client wants to access a server, and a server cannot attend (is "down"), connection between server and client is impossible.
ALWAYS RUN SERVER FIRST!

One computer can be a server and a client, both at the same time!

Servers and clients communicate through a network, the internet. Inside the internet we can find many isolated computers.
Computer are grouped in networks, connected among others.
All computers connected to the internet (and among each other) have IP addresses. IP changes depending on the computer you are connected to.
However it doesn't matter which IP address you have , you will reach to the same final point.
    Ex: My phone IP address is: 10.0.46.231
    Ex: My computer IP address is: 212.128.253.93
    Ex: The teacher's IP is: 212.128.253.64

There is a command called ping, which sends a kind of question to a server and wait for responses.
    Ex: ping time to 8.8.8.8: time=3.26 ms--- (64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=121)
    Ex:ping time to my computer: time=0.045 ms----(64 bytes from 212.128.253.93: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64)
    Ex: ping time to Sergio's computer (right):time=0.368 ms--- (64 bytes from 212.128.253.94: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64)
    Ex: ping time to my phone: time=5.98 ms---

URL: Identifying a computer interface for humans [ex: www.]
    *   Ping time to google: time=3.70 ms   *
    When you ping a web page you get the url and the ip:
        PING www.google.com (216.58.211.228) 56(84) bytes of data.
    *   Ping to urjc.es: PING www.urjc.es (212.128.240.50) 56(84) bytes of data.
                         64 bytes from www.urjc.es (212.128.240.50): icmp_seq=1 ttl=253 time=2.09 ms    *

Port: Number which indicates the position for a specific server. You need this number to connect, if you do not have it you cannot connect.
